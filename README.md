# Your task will be to build our *Search Page*!

The page can be found at https://www.joindrover.com/cars/search and there are 2 
versions of it (Consumer, Private-Hire) with very small differences between the 
two.

----
 
#### 1. Basic

- [x] Setup an app that calls our API to get vehicles for one vehicle type
- [x] Display vehicles in a list/table to the user with relevant data (eg: make, 
model, year, color, price - see notes)
- [x] Allow at least 2 fields (location is required) in search to be user inputted 
(submit button? automatic?)
- [x] *Bonus:* add some styling

#### 2. Keep going

- [x] Add all fields able to search by for one vehicle type (please see live website)
- [ ] Write unit/snapshot tests for most if not all components
- [x] Add styling to make it look like https://www.joindrover.com/cars/search
- [x] *Bonus:* add functionality for pagination

#### 3. All out!

- [x] Search can search for both types of vehicles (Consumer & Private-Hire aka PCO)
- [x] Unless already done, Pagination!!
- [x] Styling as close to original as possible
- [x] Fully responsive
- [ ] *Bonus:* add google autocomplete to the location in the search filters

## Notes

I am happy to have completed the majority of the requirements on this task. I 
plan to carry on working on this project to improve my unit testing skills and,
to learn about Google's Autocomplete API. 

This project would also be a good opportunity for me to implement Redux or to 
learn and use the Context API. 

There are a few bugs or code I would like to refactor in the future. For example,
the metadata object returned from the API provides very useful info that I could
have used better.

Overall, this was an enjoyable task to work on and I learnt a lot in the process.

#### Bugs
- chained requests are buggy

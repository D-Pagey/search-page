### Your task will be to build our *Search Page*!

The page can be found at https://www.joindrover.com/cars/search and there are 2 
versions of it (Consumer, Private-Hire) with very small differences between the 
two.

----
 
#### 1. Basic

[] Setup an app that calls our API to get vehicles for one vehicle type
[] Display vehicles in a list/table to the user with relevant data (eg: make, 
model, year, color, price - see notes)
[] Allow at least 2 fields (location is required) in search to be user inputted 
(submit button? automatic?)

*Bonus:* [] add some styling

#### 2. Keep going

[] Add all fields able to search by for one vehicle type (please see live website)
[] Write unit/snapshot tests for most if not all components
[] Add styling to make it look like https://www.joindrover.com/cars/search

*Bonus:* [] add functionality for pagination

#### 3. All out!

[] Search can search for both types of vehicles (Consumer & Private-Hire aka PCO)
[] Unless already done, Pagination!!
[] Styling as close to original as possible
[] Fully responsive

*Bonus:* [] add google autocomplete to the location in the search filters
